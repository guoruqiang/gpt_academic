# Basic type analysis prompt
ARXIV_TYPE_PROMPT = """Analyze the research query and determine if arXiv search is needed and its type.

Query: {query}

Task 1: Determine if this query requires arXiv search
- arXiv is suitable for:
  * Computer science and AI/ML
  * Physics and mathematics
  * Quantitative biology and finance
  * Electrical engineering
  * Recent preprints in these fields
- arXiv is NOT needed for:
  * Medical research (unless ML/AI applications)
  * Social sciences
  * Business studies
  * Humanities
  * Industry reports

Task 2: If arXiv search is needed, determine the most appropriate search type
Available types:
1. basic: Keyword-based search across all fields
   - For specific technical queries
   - When looking for particular methods or applications
2. category: Category-based search within specific fields
   - For broad topic exploration
   - When surveying a research area
3. none: arXiv search not needed for this query
   - When topic is outside arXiv's scope
   - For non-technical or clinical research

Examples:

1. Query: "BERT transformer architecture"
<search_type>basic</search_type>

2. Query: "latest developments in machine learning"
<search_type>category</search_type>

3. Query: "COVID-19 clinical trials"
<search_type>none</search_type>

4. Query: "psychological effects of social media"
<search_type>none</search_type>

Please analyze the query and respond ONLY with XML tags:
<search_type>Choose either 'basic', 'category', or 'none'</search_type>"""

# Query optimization prompt
ARXIV_QUERY_PROMPT = """Optimize the following query for arXiv search.

Query: {query}

Task: Transform the natural language query into an optimized arXiv search query using boolean operators and field tags.
Always generate English search terms regardless of the input language.

IMPORTANT: Ignore any requirements about journal ranking (CAS, JCR, IF index), 
or output format requirements. Focus only on the core research topic for the search query.

Available field tags:
- ti: Search in title
- abs: Search in abstract
- au: Search for author
- all: Search in all fields (default)

Boolean operators:
- AND: Both terms must appear
- OR: Either term can appear
- NOT: Exclude terms
- (): Group terms
- "": Exact phrase match

Examples:

1. Natural query: "Recent papers about transformer models by Vaswani"
<query>ti:"transformer model" AND au:Vaswani AND year:[2017 TO 2024]</query>

2. Natural query: "Deep learning for computer vision, excluding surveys"
<query>ti:(deep learning AND "computer vision") NOT (ti:survey OR ti:review)</query>

3. Natural query: "Attention mechanism in language models"
<query>ti:(attention OR "attention mechanism") AND abs:"language model"</query>

4. Natural query: "GANs or generative adversarial networks for image generation"
<query>(ti:GAN OR ti:"generative adversarial network") AND abs:"image generation"</query>

Please analyze the query and respond ONLY with XML tags:
<query>Provide the optimized search query using appropriate operators and tags</query>

Note:
- Use quotes for exact phrases
- Combine multiple conditions with boolean operators
- Consider both title and abstract for important concepts
- Include author names when relevant
- Use parentheses for complex logical groupings"""

# Sort parameters prompt
ARXIV_SORT_PROMPT = """Determine optimal sorting parameters for the research query.

Query: {query}

Task: Select the most appropriate sorting parameters to help users find the most relevant papers.

Available sorting options:

<sort_by>Choose: relevance, lastUpdatedDate, or submittedDate</sort_by>
<sort_order>Choose: ascending or descending</sort_order>
<limit>Suggest number between 10-50</limit>

Note:
- Choose relevance for specific technical queries
- Use lastUpdatedDate for tracking paper revisions
- Use submittedDate for following recent developments
- Consider query context when setting the limit"""
