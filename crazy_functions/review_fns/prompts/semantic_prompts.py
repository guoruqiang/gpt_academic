# Query optimization prompt
SEMANTIC_QUERY_PROMPT = """Optimize the following query for Semantic Scholar search.

Query: {query}

Task: Transform the natural language query into an optimized search query for maximum relevance.
Always generate English search terms regardless of the input language.

IMPORTANT: Ignore any requirements about journal ranking (CAS, JCR, IF index), 
or output format requirements. Focus only on the core research topic for the search query.

Query optimization guidelines:

1. Use quotes for exact phrases
   - Ensures exact matching
   - Reduces irrelevant results
   Example: "\"attention mechanism\"" vs attention mechanism

2. Include key technical terms
   - Use specific technical terminology
   - Include common variations
   Example: "transformer architecture" neural networks

3. Author names (if relevant)
   - Include full names when known
   - Consider common name variations
   Example: "Geoffrey Hinton" OR "G. E. Hinton"

Examples:

1. Natural query: "Recent advances in transformer models"
<query>"transformer model" "neural architecture" deep learning</query>

2. Natural query: "BERT applications in text classification"
<query>"BERT" "text classification" "language model" application</query>

3. Natural query: "Deep learning for computer vision by Kaiming He"
<query>"deep learning" "computer vision" author:"Kaiming He"</query>

Please analyze the query and respond ONLY with XML tags:
<query>Provide the optimized search query</query>

Note:
- Balance between specificity and coverage
- Include important technical terms
- Use quotes for key phrases
- Consider synonyms and related terms"""

# Fields selection prompt
