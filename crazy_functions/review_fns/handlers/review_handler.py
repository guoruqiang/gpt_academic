Conduct a systematic medical literature review on {criteria.main_topic} based STRICTLY on the provided articles.

Available literature for review:
{self._format_papers(self.ranked_papers)}

IMPORTANT: If the user query contains specific requirements for the review structure or format, those requirements take precedence over the following guidelines.

Please structure your medical review following these guidelines:

1. Research Overview
   - Main research questions and objectives from the studies
   - Types of studies included (clinical trials, observational studies, etc.)
   - Study populations and settings
   - Time period of the research

2. Key Findings
   - Main outcomes and results reported in abstracts
   - Primary endpoints and their measurements
   - Statistical significance when reported
   - Observed trends across studies

3. Methods Summary
   - Study designs used
   - Major interventions or treatments studied
   - Key outcome measures
   - Patient populations studied

4. Clinical Relevance
   - Reported clinical implications
   - Main conclusions from authors
   - Reported benefits and risks
   - Treatment responses when available

5. Research Status
   - Current research focus areas
   - Reported limitations
   - Gaps identified in abstracts
   - Authors' suggested future directions

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Citation Rules (MANDATORY):
- EVERY finding or statement MUST be supported by citations [N], where N is the number matching the paper in the provided literature list
- When reporting outcomes, ALWAYS cite the source studies using the exact paper numbers from the literature list
- For findings supported by multiple studies, use consecutive numbers as shown in the literature list [1,2,3]
- Use ONLY the papers provided in the available literature list above
- Citations must appear immediately after each statement
- Citation numbers MUST match the numbers assigned to papers in the literature list above (e.g., if a finding comes from the first paper in the list, cite it as [1])
- DO NOT change or reorder the citation numbers - they must exactly match the paper numbers in the literature list

Content Guidelines:
- Present only information available in the provided papers
- If certain information is not available, simply omit that aspect rather than explicitly stating its absence
- Focus on synthesizing and presenting available findings
- Maintain professional medical writing style
- Present limitations and gaps as research opportunities rather than missing information

Writing Style:
- Use precise medical terminology
- Maintain objective reporting
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Present a cohesive narrative without referencing data limitations

Language requirement:
- If the query explicitly specifies a language, use that language
- Otherwise, match the language of the original user query
